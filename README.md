### Lucid chart program overview
I used Lucid chart program to make an overview of how the quiz program works. It is a nice way to get an practical overview of the program. As displayed here, the steps goes like this:

*  The program starts, and ask the player for his or her name.
*  If the player writes in numbers or more then 20 caracters long, or just type enter, an valueerror arise and the player must try again to write the name.

* When the name is valid, the quiz starts and the player receives the first question. 

* To answer, the player needs to type a, b or c. If the player types numbers, other letters or empty, an valueerror will arise, and the player must try again.

* If the answer is valid, the next question will happen.

* After the quiz, the player will get an overview of the score. The player will also get an overview of other players names and scores.

* The player's name and score will then be updated in a spreadsheet.

* The program ends.
